# Healthy Life Expectancy analysis
Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE) is a measure of how many years someone can expect to live in good health. This varies greatly across unitary authorities and is measured for both men and women.

The purpose of this analysis is to look at whether there is variation in the group of unitary authorities that make up the lowest decile of HLE each year.
